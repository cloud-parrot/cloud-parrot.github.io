Out of Memory (OOM) refers to a computing state where all available memory, including swap space, has been allocated.

By default, this situation causes the system to panic and stop functioning as expected. However, setting the /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom parameter to 0 instructs the kernel to call the oom_killer function when OOM occurs.

Usually, oom_killer can kill rogue processes and the system survives. The following parameter can be set on a per-process basis, giving you increased control over which processes are killed by the oom_killer function.

It is located under /proc/pid/ in the proc file system, where pid is the process ID number. ( oom_adj in /proc/pid )

Defines a value from -16 to 15 that helps determine the oom_score of a process. The higher the oom_score value, the more likely the process will be killed by the oom_killer. Setting a oom_adj value of -17 disables the oom_killer for that process.

You can choose and modify oom_adj values of the critical processes of your system to avoid them from getting killed.
