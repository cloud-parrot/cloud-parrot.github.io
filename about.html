Writing articles is hard, but making up designs is fun. I made this site so I would be able to do both. Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the results are far from my ideal expectations, I find the whole ceremony of creativity completely enthralling. 
I'd like to think that I'm very happy person, but I find the art that strikes me truest is the sad, depressing sort. I love music and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Na4j8AVgA" target="_blank">'The Weeknd -Starboy'</a> is my favourite track:metal:, post-apocalyptic fiction, and movie trailers that can make me squirt tears in under two minutes. Go figure.
